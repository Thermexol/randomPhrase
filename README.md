# randomPhrase

## description

The purpose of this project is generate a random 'heroic' phrase. It uses three different matricies, one for the start of the phrase, 
one for the middle of the phrase and one for the end. The three parts are then logged to the console and printed out to the user who called it.
For the time being there's not too much variety in the phrases and some of them will be grammatically incorrect. But they should be amusing or inspiring.
Hope you enjoy this project.
